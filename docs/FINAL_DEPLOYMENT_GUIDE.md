cd core-emr
flyway migrate -url=jdbc:postgresql://<RDS_ENDPOINT>/osun_his
```

### 3. Deploy Services (Blue Environment)

```bash
# Build all modules
mvn clean package -DskipTests

# Deploy each service
docker-compose up -d

# Verify health
curl http://gateway:8081/actuator/health
```

### 4. Seed Data

```bash
# Seed facility data
psql -h <RDS_ENDPOINT> -U postgres -d osun_his -f sql/seed-facilities.sql

# Seed users in Keycloak
python scripts/seed_keycloak_users.py

# Seed test patients
./scripts/seed_patients.sh --count 1000
```

### 5. Configure Keycloak

```bash
# Import realm
kcadm.sh import -r osun-his -f keycloak/realms/osun-his-realm.json

# Create OIDC clients
kcadm.sh create clients -r osun-his -s clientId=admin-console -s enabled=true
```

### 6. Deploy Admin Console

```bash
cd admin-ui

# Build
npm run build

# Deploy to S3/CloudFront
aws s3 sync dist/ s3://osun-his-admin-console/
aws cloudfront create-invalidation --distribution-id <ID> --paths "/*"
```

### 7. DNS Configuration

```bash
# Create A record for API
api.osun-his.ng -> <Load Balancer IP>

# Create CNAME for Admin Console
admin.osun-his.ng -> <CloudFront Domain>
```

## üîç Post-Deployment Verification

### 1. Health Checks

```bash
# Gateway
curl https://api.osun-his.ng/actuator/health

# All services
./scripts/health-check.sh

# Admin console
curl https://admin.osun-his.ng/
```

### 2. Authentication

```bash
# Test OIDC login
curl https://api.osun-his.ng/api/patients \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
